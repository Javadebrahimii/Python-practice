1)A class is a general part, but an object is a part of it.

2) Instance variables are also commonly referred to as member variables, attributes, or fields.

3) Another name for the term method is function.

4)The dot symbol (.) 

5) A method is similar to a function in that it can perform some action and return a result, but there is one key difference: a method is associated with an object, while a function is not. A method is called on an instance of a class, and has access to the data and behavior of that instance. In contrast, a function does not have an associated object and typically operates only on the arguments that are passed to it.

6) Strip()

7) Len()

triangle:

import turtle
t =turtle.Turtle()
t.fd(100)
t.lt(120)
t.fd(100)
t.lt(120)
t.fd(100)

Star:

import turtle
t=turtle.Turtle()
for j in range(5):
	t.fd(100)
	t.lt(144)

like a mountain:

import turtle

t=turtle.Turtle()
x=50
y=100
for j in range(5):
	t.goto(x,100)
	t.goto(y,0)
	x+=100
	y+=100

Circle:
import turtule
t=turtle.Turtle()
t.circle(30)

Rotating square:

import turtle
t=turtle.Turtle()
def squre():
	for i in range(4):
		t.fd(100)
		t.lt(90)
def draw():
	for i in range(36):
		squre()
		t.lt(10)
draw()
